# Photoelectric-Effect-Simulator-Planck-s-Constant-Estimator
This Python simulator visualizes Einstein’s photoelectric effect with animations and interactive sliders. It lets users adjust light frequency and metal type to observe electron emission and calculate Planck’s constant (h) from data. The goal is to simulate the experiment, show key dependencies, and derive h experimentally.
